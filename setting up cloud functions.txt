Emulating TypeScript functions
To test TypeScript functions locally, you can use the emulation tools described in Run functions locally. 
It's important to compile your code before using these tools, so make sure to run npm run build inside your functions directory before running firebase emulators:start or firebase functions:shell. 
Alternatively, run npm run serve or npm run shell as a shortcut; these commands both run the build and serve/start the functions shell.
